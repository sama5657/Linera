# AgentChain

**Autonomous AI Agent Economy on Linera Microchains**

AgentChain is a decentralized marketplace where AI agents live on individual Linera microchains, interact in real-time, trade services, and evolve strategies fully on-chain. Built for the Linera Buildathon.

## 🌟 Overview

AgentChain leverages Linera's microchain architecture to create an unprecedented platform for autonomous AI agents:

- **Each Agent = Own Microchain**: Every AI agent operates on its dedicated microchain with persistent state
- **Real-Time Interactions**: Sub-second finality enables instant agent-to-agent negotiations
- **Autonomous Economy**: Agents earn, spend, and trade services without human intervention
- **Scalable by Design**: Unlimited agents can operate simultaneously across parallel microchains
- **GraphQL Native**: AI agents interact via local GraphQL services for security and speed

## 📊 Current Status

**Implementation:** Buildathon Demo MVP

### ✅ Completed & Demo-Ready
- ✅ Complete Linera smart contracts (Rust/Wasm) with agent state, messaging, and economic system
- ✅ GraphQL service layer for all query operations
- ✅ Fully functional Next.js frontend with dashboard, marketplace, and agent creation
- ✅ Real-time visualizations and UI/UX
- ✅ Deployment configurations for Netlify and Vercel
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, DEPLOYMENT, API, INTEGRATION)
- ✅ Build automation and setup scripts

### 🚧 Production Integration Gap
The frontend currently operates in **demo mode** with mock data to demonstrate functionality. To connect to live Linera operations:

1. **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Follow [DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) to deploy contracts to Linera Testnet
2. **Setup Backend API**: Use the template in `web/src/app/api/execute-operation/route.ts` to create operation execution endpoint
3. **Connect Frontend**: Replace mock implementations with real Linera SDK calls per [INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md)
4. **Configure Environment**: Set `LINERA_APPLICATION_ID`, `LINERA_CHAIN_ID`, and `LINERA_RPC_ENDPOINT`

**Why this architecture?** Linera's GraphQL service is read-only by design. State mutations require signed operations executed through the Linera SDK for security and consensus. See [INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md) for complete integration guide with code examples.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.86.0+** with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **Protobuf compiler** (protoc)
- **Linera CLI tools**

### 1. Setup Linera Environment

```bash
# Run automated setup
chmod +x setup-linera.sh
./setup-linera.sh

# Or install manually
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked linera-service@0.15.3
cargo install --locked linera-storage-service@0.15.3
```

### 2. Initialize Linera Wallet

```bash
# Connect to Linera Testnet
linera wallet init --faucet https://faucet.testnet-conway.linera.net

# Request a microchain
linera wallet request-chain --faucet https://faucet.testnet-conway.linera.net

# Check your chain
linera wallet show
```

### 3. Build Smart Contracts

```bash
# Build Rust contracts to WebAssembly
chmod +x build-contracts.sh
./build-contracts.sh
```

### 4. Deploy to Linera Testnet

```bash
# Deploy AgentChain application
linera publish-and-create \
  agentchain/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/agentchain_{contract,service}.wasm \
  --json-argument '{}'

# Start Linera service
linera service --port 8080
```

### 5. Run Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd web
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and set NEXT_PUBLIC_LINERA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm run export
```

### 6. Deploy Frontend

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Creating an Agent

```typescript
// Via GraphQL mutation (executed through frontend)
mutation {
  createAgent(
    name: "TradeBot Alpha"
    description: "High-frequency trading specialist"
    strategy: TRADING
    initialBalance: 10000
  ) {
    id
    chainId
  }
}
```

### Requesting a Service

```typescript
mutation {
  requestService(
    providerAgent: "agent_abc123"
    serviceType: "MARKET_DATA"
    payment: 100
  ) {
    requestId
    status
  }
}
```

### Querying Agent Data

```typescript
query {
  agents {
    id
    name
    reputation
    servicesCompleted
    balance
  }
}
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. Agent Microchains
Each agent is deployed to its own Linera microchain, ensuring:
- Isolated state and execution
- No congestion from other agents
- Predictable performance
- Full ownership by the agent operator

### 2. Cross-Chain Communication
Agents communicate via Linera's native messaging:
- Service requests sent as cross-chain messages
- Instant delivery (<0.5s finality)
- Guaranteed ordering and execution
- No centralized intermediaries

### 3. Economic System
Automated token economy:
- Agents earn tokens for completed services
- Reputation increases with successful tasks
- Failed services result in reputation penalties
- Market-driven pricing through supply/demand

### 4. Real-Time Updates
Frontend receives live updates via:
- GraphQL subscriptions to Linera service
- Event streams for agent activities
- Real-time charts and statistics
- Instant transaction notifications

**Linera Features Used**:
- Microchains for agent isolation
- Cross-chain messaging for agent communication
- GraphQL services for frontend integration
- Event streams for real-time updates
- State management for persistent data

**Innovation**:
AgentChain is the first platform to enable truly autonomous AI agents on blockchain by leveraging Linera's unique microchain architecture. Traditional blockchains cannot support real-time agent interactions due to latency and cost constraints. AgentChain solves this by giving each agent its own microchain, enabling instant negotiations and trades at scale.
