Don't start building anything untill i say "Build" ok

this is about event that "Build Real-Time Onchain Apps on Linera Microchains"

🚀 What is Linera?
Linera is the first real-time Layer-1 blockchain designed for the next generation of interactive, agentic applications. Its core innovation is the microchain — a lightweight, parallel chain assigned to each user or app. This architecture eliminates global bottlenecks, enabling instant finality, predictable scalability, and a Web3 experience that feels as fast as Web2.

⚡ Why Build on Linera
For developers, Linera’s architecture unlocks an entirely new design space. You can build apps that update live, scale linearly with users, and interact safely with AI agents — all while staying fully decentralized.

Predictable Performance: No gas wars or congestion — your app runs at the same speed no matter how many users join.
Agentic Integration: AI agents can transact directly via MCP/GraphQL without centralized intermediaries.
Real-Time UX: Push updates instantly and deliver a smooth, interactive experience on-chain.
Build the next generation of real-time, intelligent Web3 apps — powered by Linera.

🔥 What You Get by Joining
🧪 Build on Linera Testnet
Linera is currently in testnet and pre-token. This Buildathon is your chance to get hands-on with a new L1 before mainnet.

Deploy your app, collect feedback from real users, and position yourself to be among the first wave of projects launching on mainnet in 2026.

💬 Direct Mentorship
Work directly with Linera founder Mathieu Baudet and the core protocol, infra, and community leads. Get targeted feedback, technical guidance, and insights as you build.

🏆 Guaranteed Rewards
Every approved project earns the Builder role on Discord, a limited-edition POAP, and a share of 500,000 XP — recognizing your contribution to the Linera ecosystem.

🔁 Build in Waves
Each wave is a new chance to refine your project. Apply feedback, resubmit, and keep leveling up toward Demo Day.

🎤 Demo Day @ ETH Denver 2026
Top teams will be invited to present live at ETH Denver 2026, gaining exposure to investors, partners, and the Web3 community. (Teams are responsible for travel and lodging.)

⚡ What Should I Build?
Linera’s low-latency microchains make it possible to build markets that react instantly — updating, clearing, and resolving in real time.

This buildathon challenges builders to invent new kinds of on-chain apps where speed, interactivity, and information flow define the game.

🧮 1. Prediction Markets
Build fast, simple markets that trade on live events.

Real-time betting on sports, esports, or cultural moments
Micro-markets that resolve in minutes or even per play
AI bots that set odds, trade, or make predictions

🎮 2. Games
Create on-chain games that react in real time.

Turn-based games like chess, cards, or strategy duels
Multiplayer or live-action games with instant state updates
AI-powered NPCs, gameplay logic, or storytelling

🧰 3. Market Infrastructure
Develop oracles and tools for creating and analyzing real-time markets.

AI agents that create or manage prediction markets automatically.
Dashboards for live data and performance tracking
Copy-trading or strategy-sharing tools
Market resolution oracles (e.g. using TEE execution or voting committees)
