2. Follow each step carefully
3. Check off items as you complete them
4. Refer to the troubleshooting sections if you get stuck

## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Will the error messages on the UI disappear?

**Yes!** Once you complete the deployment and connect to the real blockchain (Steps 9-11 in the deployment guide), all these errors will disappear:

- "Not connected to Linera blockchain"
- "Failed to fetch agents"
- "GraphQL endpoint not available"
- Loading states that never finish

They are only shown when the frontend can't reach the GraphQL service.

### What order should I read these documents?

2. **FEATURE_ROADMAP.md** - Read this to understand what's coming next
3. **INTEGRATION.md** - Read this if you want technical details
4. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Use this as a quick reference later

### I'm stuck, what should I do?
